        <img src="Assets/Images/profilepicture.jpg" class="profilepic">
        <p>Hello! I am a 28 year old post fashion professional looking to 
            make a career change into the world of software engineering. Born and raised into 
            Seattle, WA where I attended college at Seattle Central College. Relocated to 
            New York City for 7 years to take a bite of the Big Apple.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am a proud father of a beautiful husky/pitbull rescue named 
            Apollo. He's a huge sweetheart & would love to meet you too!</p>
        <br>
        <p>My hobbies include; hiking, running with Apollo, playing soccer
             (not watching), and killin' it on my Nintendo Switch.</p>
